# Google Review Classification - Sentiment Analysis Web App

This is a Flask-based web application developed as part of my undergraduate research project.  
The system performs **sentiment analysis on Google Reviews** using classical machine learning algorithms to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**, and determine the overall favorability of an attraction.
